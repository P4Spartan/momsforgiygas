Welcome to P4Spartan's personal TF2 cloud-based dedicated server! This is not my first TF2 server, as I have previously hosted via dedicated, homegrown methods and via VPS, but it is a treat to utilize the array of tools supplied by NFO Servers.

The server will reset every day at midnight, followed by a complete refresh every Wednesday at 6 PM EST.

This server rotates through a mix of base game maps and custom maps, with other gamemodes soon to be added.

Hopefully you all enjoy! There are ways to assist the funds of this server, but I would prefer if you just sat back and enjoyed the thrilling ride instead!

If you absolutely want to donate, then you can at the following link, but it is entirely up to you
